This directory contains external projects, taken from the following locations:

googletest: https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/release-1.10.0
 - changed: https://github.com/google/googletest/pull/2514
cryptopp: https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/tree/CRYPTOPP_8_2_0
 - changed: added CMakeLists.txt and cryptopp-config.cmake from https://github.com/noloader/cryptopp-cmake/tree/CRYPTOPP_8_2_0
 - changed: commented out line including winapifamily.h in CMakeLists.txt
 - changed: In CMakeLists.txt, rename BUILD_TESTING to CRYPTOPP_BUILD_TESTING so it doesn't clash with our BUILD_TESTING
 - changed: Fix Android compilation using patch file https://github.com/termux/termux-root-packages/files/4664745/config.h.patch.txt from https://github.com/cryfs/cryfs/issues/345
aws-sdk: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/1.6.49
 - changed: removed all aws-cpp-sdk-* directories except aws-cpp-sdk-core and aws-cpp-sdk-s3. They're too large and not needed.
 - comment out "find_package(Git)" in root CMakeLists.txt because the .git directory isn't present. It doesn't need it anyways but would print a warning in the build otherwise.
